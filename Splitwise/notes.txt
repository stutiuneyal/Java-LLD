Actors:

1 -> User
2 -> Expenses (Add/ Settle)
3 -> Balance Tracking (Track who ows whom and the amount)

Simplifying:

A -> B(100)
B -> C(50)

=> A -> C(100)

A -> B -> C -> Wont work

Current Implementation: Map -> Chain (A->B(amount)) & (B->C(amount))

Now what I have to think is how to collapse these chains: A->C(amount)

Net -> [net(user) = total amount to receive - total amount to pay]
if net > 0 -> user must receive
else net < 0 -> user must pay


creditor: net > 0
debtor : net < 0

Greedy Setllement:

- take one debtor and one creditor
- settle -> min(creditor, -1 * debtor)
- reduce both the amount -> by the settle amount
- whoever becomes 0 -> remove
